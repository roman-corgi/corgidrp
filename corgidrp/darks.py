    Get mean frame and corresponding bad-pixel map from L2b data frames.  The
    input image_list should consist of frames with no bad pixels marked or

    the mean.

    The two lists must be the same length, and each 2D array in each list must
    be the same size, both within a list and across lists.

    If the inputs are instead np.ndarray (a single frame or a stack),
    the function will accommodate and convert them to lists of arrays.

    Also Includes outputs for processing darks used for calibrating the
    master dark.

        image_list (list or array_like): List (or stack) of L2b data frames
    (with no bad pixels applied to them).
        bpmap_list (list or array_like): List (or stack) of bad-pixel maps
        associated with L2b data frames. Each must be 0 (good) or 1 (bad)
        at every pixel.
        err (bool):  If True, calculates the standard error over all
        the frames.  Intended for the corgidrp.Data.Dataset.all_err
        arrays. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        comb_image (array_like): Mean-combined frame from input list data.

        comb_bpmap (array_like): Mean-combined bad-pixel map.

        map_im (array-like): Array showing how many frames per pixel were
        unmasked. Used for getting read noise in the calibration of the
        master dark.

        enough_for_rn (bool): Useful only for the calibration of the master dark.
        False:  Fewer than half the frames available for at least one pixel in
        the averaging due to masking, so noise maps cannot be effectively
        determined for all pixels.
        True:  Half or more of the frames available for all pixels, so noise

    - have been corrected for nonlinearity
    - have been converted from DN to e-

    CIC_map : array-like (full frame)

        values from the fit are made positive in the end.
    DC_map : array-like (full frame)

    bias_offset : float
        The median for the residual FPN+CIC in the region where bias was

    bias_offset_up : float
        The upper bound of bias offset, accounting for error in input datasets
        and the fit.
    bias_offset_low : float
        The lower bound of bias offset, accounting for error in input datasets
        and the fit.
    FPN_image_map : array-like (image area)
        A per-pixel map of fixed-pattern noise in the image area (in deteceted EM electrons).

    CIC_image_map : array-like (image area)
        A per-pixel map of EXCAM clock-induced charge in the image area
        (in deteceted EM electrons). Any negative values from the fit are made positive in the end.

    read_noise : float
        Read noise estimate from the noise profile of a mean frame (in deteceted EM electrons).
        It's read off from the sub-stack with the lowest product of EM gain and
        frame time so that the gained variance of C and D is comparable to or
        lower than read noise variance, thus making reading it off doable.
        If read_noise is returned as NaN, the read noise estimate is not
        trustworthy, possibly because not enough frames were used per substack
        for that or because the next lowest gain setting is much larger than
        the gain used in the sub-stack.  The official calibrated read noise
        comes from the k gain calibration, and this is just a rough estimate
        that can be used as a sanity check, for checking agreement with the
        official calibrated value.
    R_map : array-like
        A per-pixel map of the adjusted coefficient of determination
        (adjusted R^2) value for the fit.
    FPN_image_mean : float
        F averaged over all pixels,
        before any negative ones are made positive.  Should be roughly the same
        as taking the mean of F_image_map.  This is just for comparison.
    CIC_image_mean : float
        C averaged over all pixels,
        before any negative ones are made positive.  Should be roughly the same
        as taking the mean of C_image_map.  This is just for comparison.
    DC_image_mean : float
        D averaged over all pixels,
        before any negative ones are made positive.  Should be roughly the same
        as taking the mean of D_image_map.  This is just for comparison.
    unreliable_pix_map : array-like (full frame)
        A pixel value in this array indicates how many sub-stacks are usable
        for a fit for that pixel.  For each sub-stack for which
        a pixel is masked for more than half of
        the frames in the sub-stack, 1 is added to that pixel's value
        in unreliable_pix_map.  Since the least-squares fit function has 3
        parameters, at least 4 sub-stacks are needed for a given pixel in order
        to perform a fit for that pixel.  The pixels in unreliable_pix_map that
        are >= len(stack_arr)-3 cannot be fit.  NOTE:  This is used for the
        output Dark's dq after assigning these pixels a flag value of 256.
        They should have large err values.
        The pixels that are masked for EVERY frame in all sub-stacks
        but 4 (or less) are assigned a flag value of
        1, which falls under the category of "Bad pixel - unspecified reason".
        These pixels would have no reliability for dark subtraction.
    FPN_std_map : array-like (full frame)
        The standard deviation per pixel for the calibrated FPN.
    CIC_std_map : array-like (full frame)
        The standard deviation per pixel for the calibrated CIC.
    DC_std_map : array-like (full frame)
        The standard deviation per pixel for the calibrated dark current.
    stacks_err : array-like (full frame)
        Standard error per pixel coming from the frames in datasets used to
        calibrate the noise maps.
    noise_maps : corgidrp.data.DetectorNoiseMaps instance
        Includes a 3-D stack of frames for the data, err, and the dq.
        input data: np.stack([FPN_map, CIC_map, DC_map])
        input err:  np.stack([FPN_std_map, C_std_map_combo, DC_std_map])
        All 3 of these include the fitting error, but C_std_map_combo includes
        also the statistical error across the frames and accounts for any err
        content of the individual input frames.  We include it in the CIC part
        since it will not be scaled by EM gain or exposure time when the master
        dark is created.  In all the err, masked pixels are accounted for in
        the calculations.
        input dq:   np.stack([output_dq, output_dq, output_dq])

        The header info is taken from that of
        one of the frames from the input datasets and can be changed via a call

        Assemble a master dark SCI frame (full or image)
        from individual noise components.

        This is done this way because the actual dark frame varies with gain and
        exposure time, and both of these values may vary over orders of magnitude
        in the course of acquisition, alignment, and HOWFSC.  Better to take data
        sets that don't vary.

        Output is a bias-subtracted, gain-divided master dark in electrons.
        (Bias is inherently subtracted as we don't use it as
        one of the building blocks to assemble the dark frame.)

        Master dark = (F + g*t*D + g*C)/g = F/g + t*D + C where
        F = FPN (fixed-pattern noise) map
        g = EM gain
        t = exposure time
        D = dark current map
        C = CIC (clock-induced charge) map

        Arguments:
        dataset: corgidrp.data.Dataset instance.  The dataset should consist of
            frames all with the same EM gain and exposure time, which are read
            off from the dataset headers.
        noisemaps: corgidrp.data.DetectorNoiseMaps instance.  The noise maps used
            to build the master dark.
        detector_regions: dict.  A dictionary of detector geometry properties.
            Keys should be as found in detector_areas in detector.py. Defaults to
            detector_areas in detector.py.
        full_frame: bool.  If True, a full-frame master dark is generated (which
            may be useful for the module that statistically fits a frame to find
            the empirically applied EM gain, for example). If False, an image-area
            master dark is generated.  Defaults to False.

        Returns:
        master_dark:  corgidrp.data.Dark instance.
            This contains the master dark in detected electrons.
