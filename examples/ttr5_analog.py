## This file is meant to provide an example of the different pipeline steps
## that we will need to run for a TTR5-like observation. This is not meant to
## be a working example, but rather a template for the different 
## steps that we will need to run. It's not even really meant to show how 
## the pipeline will actually work. Most of the functions are just placeholders
## and their exact names and home files are only preliminary suggestions.
